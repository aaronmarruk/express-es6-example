# express-es6-example

This is a super simple Express.js boilerplate implementing ES6 features. I've built this as a quick-start boilerplate for starting new Express projects.

What this includes: not a lot! At the moment: 

1. Babel transforms
2. Nodemon
3. Eslint

I may add more to this if I think it will help quickstart Express hacking projects.
